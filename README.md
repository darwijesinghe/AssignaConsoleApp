# Assigna Console App

## Project Purpose

This simple task management console application was made to showcase my coding ability to those who would like to hire me as a .NET developer.

This app was mainly developed to demonstrate basic CRUD operations and API consumption using .NET Core REST API as a backend. This full app was designed and developed by myself and can use for a small team to simply manage their project tasks.
